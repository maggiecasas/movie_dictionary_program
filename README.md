Movie Dictionary Program

This project was created as part of Lab 8 for the course Business Application Programming at Florida International University (FIU). 
The program demonstrates how to use Python dictionaries, loops, and random selection.

What it does:
- Stores two dictionaries with movies and their running times
- Combines them into one dictionary
- Filters movies longer than 10 minutes
- Randomly selects five movies to create a “binge set”
- Prints the total runtime as it goes

How to run:
1. Download the file casasnovas_lab8.py
2. Open a terminal or IDE and run: python casasnovas_lab8.py
3. The program will display a random list of movies with their total viewing time

Example output:
TMC Binge Set — Oscar Movies
****************************************
All About My Mother — 101 min (Total: 101)
Solomon and Gaenor — 105 min (Total: 206)
Local Community Announcements — 12 min (Total: 218)
The Old Man and the Sea — 20 min (Total: 238)
My Grandmother Ironed the King’s Shirts — 11 min (Total: 249)

Note: The output will vary each time because of the random selection.
